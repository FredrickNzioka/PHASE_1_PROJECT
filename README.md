# PHASE_1_PROJECT
Overview

This project provides a comprehensive dataset and tools for analyzing aviation-related data. It includes information on Aircraft Makes, Models, and Engine Types.
This analysis derives its data from the Aviation_data.csv whose original source is the USA National Transportation Safety Board. 

Business Understanding 

This assignment focuses to give an analysis of the aircraft accidents with a view to show the aircraft whose accident impact would be minimal. It also focuses to give the aircraft with the least reported cases of accidents.
Risk assessment in entry to new ventures is a critical aspect. Investment in the aviation industry is a capital intensive endeavour which would require research.
 
Key stakeholders
1. The Board, Management and shareholders of Nzeves Group PLC.
2. The Kenya Civil Aviation Authority
3. Kenya Airports Authority
4. Capital Markets Authority

Business Questions
   1. Which make of aircraft has the least number of reported accidents?
   2. What is the relationship between the number of Total Fatal injuries reported and aircraft Make?
   3. What is the relationship between Number of Total injuries reported and type of engine?
      
Data Understanding and Analysis

This analysis involves use of Jupyter notebook as an intergrated developnment environment of choice.. It utilises Pandas Library for exploratory data analysis and data cleaning.
Source of data
This analysis derives its data from the Aviation_data.csv whose original source is the USA National Transportation Safety Board.

Observations 
1. Personal aircraft accidents take the biggest proportion of aircraft accidents reported.
2.  The number of reported aircraft accidents remained low until the year 1950 when they started to rise.


Conclusion.
1. The company should consider purchasing an aircraft with the least number of reported accident cases. In this case, based on the analysis made, Honda aircraft has been observed to be the aircraft with the least cases of accidents reported.
2. Aircrafts fitted with reciprocating engine type have the high number of fatal injuries reported whenever an accident occurred.
While making a choice of the aircraft by engine, the management         should avoid aircrafts with this type of engine.
3. There is also need to do further analysis using other statistical measures to analyse whether there could be any correlations between weather conditions and number of accidents reported and as well as its effect to number of injuries.
